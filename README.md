# SwiftBigInt
An exploration of big integer types in Swift

Somehow, this got lost in type-boxing, and never made it to the BigInt types or calculations.

It turns out that you can't quite imitate a standard integer type in Swift. So this project might have been doomed to failure from the start. (Some types and protocols are internal. And there are other quirks that make it harder than it should be.)
